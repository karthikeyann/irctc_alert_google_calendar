Enter days of travel and add reminders to Google Calendar.

Your android phone will automatically give notification. In fact, it can give notification previous day evening to sleep early to book tickets at early 8 am next morning! :) 

Using Web  APIs only, adding new event to google calendar to remind you to book tickets. 

I used the following APIs to get this project working.
